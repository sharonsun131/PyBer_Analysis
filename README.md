## Summary: There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 

1. Urban cities have the highest total fare and total rides among these there city types. AS a result, the majority pf Pyber's revenue occurs in urban cityes. Therefore it is the best performing city type and should be invested more in this type to make more profits. 
 
 
2. After reviewing the Total Fare by City Type line chart, I find out that at the end of February is the peak time. It is a good time to invest more in marketing and advertising. 

3. Due to the fact that there are more total drivers than total rides in the urban cities, PyBer should considering increase the investment is marketing to get more total rides in urban cities, otehrwise it will lose drivers.
